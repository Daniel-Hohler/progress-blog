title: "Beginning Of Sorting Project" date: 2023-10-5

Today I began working on a new python project which will visualize the quicksort sorting method.
I began by reinstalling python 3.12, and also adding it to the system variables under my computer
as python and command such as pip were not being recognized. I also made the change from pyCharm
to VS code as I've had more practice under VS code and decided it was a better workplace.
I then created the new repositry along with the project folder onto my computer and began working.
I first installed both numPy and matplotlib in order to have the necessary tools to accomplish 
this task. After installing both librarys I was able to create a randomized array of numbers between
0-100. Once making this array I was able to plot them which is where I ran into my first problem.
Once plotting the array using the plt.bar function, all of my values were being organized already as
I had made the height the randomized array aswell. I solved this issue by creating an organized list 
of numbers between 0-99 which then allowed my numbers to be plotted in a random order. The final
thing I accomplished today was researching over quicksort and how it functioned and creating a basic 
quicksort function which I tested and had worked. My next step is to learn how to actively update
the graph and how to visualize each step of what the sort is doing.
