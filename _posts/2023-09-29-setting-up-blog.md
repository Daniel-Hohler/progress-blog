title: "Setting Up The Blog"
date: 2023-09-29

  Today I set up my blog through utilizing Jekyll and Github Pages. A problem I ran into was github actions not working correctly.
I found the error within the code which required me to change some of the pull request policies and after rerunning actions it worked correctly.
